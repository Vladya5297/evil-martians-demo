# Application

It's a simple application to provide some examples of my coding skills.
Focused on maintable components, nice project structure and usage of some libraries.
Please, notice, it's impossible to show all my knowledge in this single app.

# Project structure

| Directory | Description |
| - | - |
| [configs](./configs/) | Storage for webpack configs for prod and dev environment. |
| [src](./src/) | Main storage of application files. |
| [src/components](./src/components) | Place to store all commonly used presentational components. You can think of it as ui-kit. |
| [src/images](./src/images) | Static images folder. |
| [src/pages](./src/pages) | Here you can split your app into pages. Every page could contain its own components dir. Each component here can manipulate data, do requests and not necessarily be reusable. |
| [src/types](./src/types) | Type declarations. |
| [src/utils](./src/utils) | Sharable utils. |
